I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at University at Buffalo, SUNY. I'm interested in the study of online hate and offensiveness, AI/ML security, OSNs security and more relevant research topics. I'm honored to work under the guidance of Dr. [Hongxin Hu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hongxinh/), whose expertise and tutelage has been invaluable to my work. 

Please feel free to contact me via email, I would be more than happy to have a discussion and to learn from you.
