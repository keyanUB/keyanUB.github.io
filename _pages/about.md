I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at University at Buffalo, SUNY. I'm interested in the study of large-scale generative AI, online hate and offensiveness, AI/ML security, Generative AI for Public Good, OSNs security and more relevant research topics. I'm honored to work under the guidance of Dr. [Hongxin Hu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hongxinh/), whose expertise and tutelage have been invaluable to my work. 

Please feel free to contact me via [email](keyanguo@buffalo.edu), I would be more than happy to have a discussion and to learn from you.
